# A PISP build writes static asset tables once per build and time-varying schedule tables under one or more schedule directories. The tables below list the current output names, identifiers, relationships, and columns.

# ## Schedule value semantics
#
# Each schedule row applies to one asset, scenario, and timestamp. The `value` column overlays the corresponding static quantity when reconstructing the system state for that scenario and time. The schedules covered here are read from the live schedule container, so the table always lists exactly the schedules a build writes.

## backend escapes backticks and underscores, which would strip the inline-code
## formatting these interpretation tables rely on.

# Inflow schedules are approximate energy allocations for one unit of the relevant asset. The applicable unit-count field or schedule determines the aggregate quantity represented by multiple units.

# ## Derived quantities
#
# These quantities are not written as separate columns; they are reconstructed from the static columns when building a system state. Each uses the applicable static or scheduled value for the selected scenario and timestamp: when a corresponding schedule exists, its `value` replaces the static field before the quantity is derived.

## Reconstruction conventions applied by downstream use of the per-unit columns.
## Each factor is validated against the live static schema, so a renamed column
## fails the render rather than leaving a stale formula.

# A full outage removes the affected unit from service. A partial outage leaves the unit available at a reduced capability determined by the partial-outage and derating parameters. Mean time to repair is the average restoration duration after the corresponding outage state.

# ## Output directory pattern
#
# Static tables are written directly under a format directory such as `csv/` or `arrow/`. Time-varying tables are written under `schedule-<tag>/`, where the tag is either a planning year or an explicit date range.
#
# A schedule is an overlay, not an independent asset inventory. Reconstruct a system state by selecting the required scenario and timestamp, joining the schedule to its static table, and replacing only the quantity represented by the schedule.

# ## Using the output tables
#
# - Identifier columns define table relationships; row order does not.
# - `scenario` and `date` are part of the schedule key even when an analysis displays only one scenario or period.
# - Units follow the represented quantity: power and transfer limits are in MW, storage energy and inflow quantities are in MWh, and unit-count schedules are counts.
# - Solar and wind schedule values should not be normalised by static `Generator.pmax` without applying the modelling convention described in [Assumptions and scope](@ref).
